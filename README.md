# Design

## Inspiration:

The book idea come from my brother due to the knowledge given about how he works in library&#39;s. The information they hold and explained the data within a library is endless. So many books are released stored and recycled. Books are only removed due to purchase, damage or loss. With this design it will start with a book and continue to grow the more users that join the bigger the data collection. This will be growth in the number of books, reviews and users on the site. Books impress users by the description of the story, the title and user&#39;s opinion of a book. Overall, the main opinion that matters is the user but if it can help others have interest then there is a bigger outcome. If a review is good it will encourage users not only to get the book being reviewed but it will also broaden the users&#39; mind. In the aspect of reading more books from the author producing more reviews and interesting others who might read similar books. Overall a book website was perfect for what is being created. Not only does it meet the requirements in providing useable information to others, it also provides a design interest and impact on the user. Therefore, I believed this would be perfect as I know how a library works in general, I understand the data aspect and believe everyone uses them for story&#39;s and to acquire knowledge. This spans into countless data.

## Font

Dafont was a reliable webpage with interesting font to use therefore I have used the following (Badly Stamped). The font selected was from [www.dafont.com](http://www.dafont.com/) it was perfect and suited for the theme of the site. I had I searched through several fonts and believed this was an excellent font giving the site a different dynamic and edge. It had the style that I was looking for and gave the font a better design overall on the webpage. Examples have been provided below.

## ![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_a8a1357e397b4050.png) Colours

I used the colours selected above as the complicated each other. I searched several sites for good combinations of colours working well together giving a presence. The orange, white, dark grey and black worked very well for me. I believed the sight would be bright for the users and have specific criteria stand out where required. I tried several different colours to check and personally didn&#39;t find it appealing nor did it make an impact on the website when implementing the colour. The colours selected were popular across various sites such as [https://www.tailorbrands.com/blog/logo-color-combinations](https://www.tailorbrands.com/blog/logo-color-combinations). Therefore, as I had seen the colour group together and enjoyed the colours myself I decided it was best to use due to the presence it gave for the website idea and design.

## Icons/Images

With the help of font awesome I was able to implement a varied number of icons on to the page. The icons help indicate the requirement or purpose of the section. Example being sign up for the website would be a pen and image logo to upload a picture for the book. The logos give more of a design effect on the website and make it more interactive for users. I believe the icons in the right place and correct icon used bring a custom design to the site and attention to detail supplied. This helps users enjoy and appreciate the site more that it has been created with effective detail and help support users in a hidden way. There are a few examples of the icons added below to show what has been used on the website.

## Content Section

The content for website has been separated into the books that can be selected, reviews page for adding, updating, editing and deleting. On the home page the website will show the books via 3 books per row. Display the latest book at the bottom of the page. With the mobile device it will one book per row and tablet device will be 2-3 depending on size of the tablet.

For small devices this has been set to be viewed as 1 book per row. Depending on the tablet size it can be 3 books per row. I believe this can be implemented and can be improved on small devices in the future and something to work on. I believe the book should be the main object the users see this will improve the interest rate with interacting with the site for books and review information. The book site target is to capture the user&#39;s attention for new books to find and share with others. Including the objective for the users to find books with ease. Via scrolling or using the search bar to find the book they desire.

The users will have the ability to select the book present on the main page or search for a book via the search bar. When selecting a book of their choice the website will provide the user with the book details e.g., image and book description. If logged in the user will be able to add a review if they wish to do so. The user will also be able to review the latest 3 reviews on the book they are currently viewing. If there&#39;s no reviews then it will indicate no reviews available. This maybe the book hasn&#39;t been reviewed or it has been newly added. Once the user decides to add a review clicking the button, they&#39;ll be referred to a form requiring the book details and upload a book image if required.

Current format and size have been provided from amazon due to the clean book covers. Once the users upload the review, they can see the newly added view on the selected books content page. This will allow the user to add another review, amend a review or delete a review. If they add a review, they will get a time and date stamp automatically. When adding a review, the user can put a like on the book or dislike and thumb will indicate thumb up for yes, they like the book or a thumb down for no.

Users don&#39;t have access to deleting books only reviews the admins can remove books. This has been input so that other users of the books on the website or added reviews aren&#39;t reviewed in error.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq frameworks was perfect to get a mock up design and use ideas in website layout and helped me decide site functionality. When creating the home space, it creates a wave of ideas. Designing and planning was much easier using Balsamiq frameworks previous was sketching my site design on paper and pen. If any changes are implemented then I can discuss the changes from the original idea and show how I&#39;ve improved the design. This way it will indicate the improvements and the reasoning behind changing the design.

The created wireframes below will show the design and the idea of how I wanted the website to be laid out from my ideas. I will try and match the wireframe design to the website pages displayed and improve the project as I go if I deem the change necessary. The changes will be mentioned in the final part of the Readme file showing from the original design and the end product. Websites can change when designing due to either improvements implemented or due to errors that need to be fixed and resolved.

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_4873ec95c0d4683a.png)

## Features to Improve/Implement

### 1. e-book speech

Users will be able to play the description or short paragraph from the story. It would be for people with difficulty and people who want to hear the book out loud. It would be a great feature to have on the system.

### 2. Book Linking

Links when picking a book directing users to similar genres or other books from the author in relation to the book the user is viewing. This would require algorithms to be implemented to find the correct information.

### 3. Book Recommendations for users

When the user&#39;s login to their account on their profile not only will there be there reviews on the book but the users will also have books recommended by the website that they may interested in. This would help expand the books the users view and open up the various book options the user has and build a potential interest for the user.

### 4. Theme Swaps

The current theme is pleasant for users and matches well. The option for users to pick all the main colours such as red, green, blue, yellow etc they can pick a theme for the site they would enjoy they like. Boys blue and Girls pink for example. This would be more tailored to the users.

## Scalable and Easy to Maintain Code

### Make Code easier to maintain

Using a block content code including content read for each website main the generic design each and simple to keep everything the same and 100% accurate. This was easy for amending purposes and ensure the design was constant throughout the website. This enabled the different sites to be created a lot better and more efficiently when required. Its easy to break down the code with comments to ensure the information on the site was correct also and easy to debug code if necessary. Any issues with the code would come from the concept and not the base site block included on each page.

# Technologies used

For the website the following programming languages have been used HTML, CSS, Heroku, MongoDB and JavaScript programming languages.

- [GitHub](https://github.com/) – The project required and believed GitHub was the best for storing the projects details and easily be used for remote access when required.
- [JQuery](https://jquery.com/) - used to simplify some DOM manipulation for certain functions
- [GitPod](https://gitpod.io/) – Great toll to be sued for the development of the website and using the platform to complete the website as required. This helped fulfil the potential to complete the website.
- [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/) – Launch the application code via Heroku used via deployment
- [Materialize](https://materializecss.com/) – Helped support the coding queries necessary such as colours and grid information when necessary. The site also made footers very easy to include.
- [Favicon](https://favicon.io/favicon-generator/) - Used to provide unique logo for the web page icon section
- [Dafont](http://www.dafont.com/) for the site font styled for a customer and unique feel.
- [Basalmiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/desktop/) - Used for wireframe creation using professional tools to support the design
- [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools) - Audit you used it for your accessibility testing

## Data Infrastructure

### Database Choice

This project was required to be based on a NoSQL database structure so MongoDb was used.

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_f445f8679745e9e6.png) ![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_c6cab398e31a2a7c.png)

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_3f189cb28289e555.png)

# Testing

## Validation Testing

I used the following websites and pasted my code into it to ensure the code had no syntax errors:

- **JavaScript -** [**https://jshint.com/**](https://jshint.com/)
- **HTML -** [**https://validator.w3.org/**](https://validator.w3.org/)
- **CSS -** [**https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/**](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/)
- **Lighthouse -** [**https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm\_source=devtools**](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/?utm_source=devtools)

## User Stories Testing

### Automated

Jasmine testing would be ideal in testing the book website. As we have tested during the end process of the website and nearing the end of the requirement timescale the action cannot be completed. Due to time constraints and working on the other aspects of the game I couldn&#39;t pursue the possible requirement.

### Manual

Manual testing was completed on the website. This included book searches, details displayed, add and review information and many more tests that actioned during the website building progression. The details have been provided below showing the result of the testing via a desktop website, mobile and tablet. The responsive device was fine when testing on a desktop page. Therefore, attempt testing on a small platform and a medium platform would be ideal to ensure they have been built and support all platforms available.

### Testing Client Stories from UX Section

Manually testing was completed to ensure the website met the user stories requirements. This would ensure the website has been checked and satisfies the users. This including what they want the website to do and how they want it to work. A list of the requirements has been provided below for reference. This is to show the testing&#39;s made and also the results of the tests. This would help satisfy the users of the website.

### Cross Browser Testing

Various browsers were tested with the game link to ensure it would work on the browsers selected and available to use. This would ensure the website was available to a vast number of users. Giving the website a better fan base due to no limitations using the books 2 review website.

## Lighthouse Audit

&quot;Identify and fix common problems that affect your sites performance, accessibility, and user experience.&quot;

Accessibility testing was conducted on the site to ensure it was suitable and performing to a suitable score for users and their experience on the website. This way the site can potentially work to its maximum performance. This is completed by selected the lighthouse option on the developer tool and generating a report for the selected device. This can be mobile or desktop devices.

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_35bd7b1ecf9d9ed0.png)

The result for mobile was 100 which is acceptable for the website and performance. As mentioned in the mobile review improvement to be completed as a future improvement. . (Image below first check for Books 2 review after the website was functioning)

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_fb83c331cbb0a522.png)

The results for desktop are 99 which is a worthy score for a website but I would look to improve the score where possible this can be a future update and performance improvement. (Image below first check for Books 2 review after the website was functioning)

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_720e1a8c66f8707.png)

![](RackMultipart20201217-4-k4sg7z_html_ebfa2e7bab79b70c.png)

Initially the first light house check for mobile and desktop was pretty and a good result but it can be improved which would be best practice to be actioned. Ensuring its suitable for all users. Therefore, the web pages have been reviewed to ensure the code works accordingly and any errors are resolved. The functionality of the website is every important and helps with the loading as well as displaying correctly and providing clean code. For errors the mark up validation was used to ensure any issues were resolved on the order. This was key to checking the code and making sure it would be accessible for all years of the web.

Mobile Accessibility Improvement

Desktop Accessibility Improvement

## Bugs Discovered

| **Features** | **Description** | **Steps to Reproduce** | **Resolution** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Book description** | Issues with the add book page when adding information to the book description the label wasn&#39;t moving above the content line. Therefore, when typing in the required field the text would be behind the book description label. This therefore proving difficult to view the information and provided poor visibility. | On the add book page go to the description section and add a description of a book or add random text. To see if the text is behind the book description label. | On the add\_book.html template add the following criteria as it was incorrect. Type=&quot;text in the input id field and deleted the data-error field &#39;data-error=&quot;&#39;. This field is required&quot; as it was not required for this section. This mirrored the other labels provided on the add book page. |
| Accessibility Score | The accessibility score was quite high overall. Although the score is high it can be improved and can make the website function become a lot better and more responsive. | Remove some code and generate the report this is very broadband but the more important the code the higher the drop. The current code is high from the review therefore the fix would be to improve where necessary. Removing the code is an example how the website can be affected. | Using a code checker that provides issues or using the lighthouse generated report review the information and improve where necessary when coding. The fix was to go through step by step all the code to improve where possible and necessary to remove any errors. |
| Book details display not in the correct position due to code not being right | When viewing the book details the title would cause I misplacement of the reviews box on the right-hand side. The website would not display to its bets potential | Select the book details page when loading the page, the reviews table and the book image box wont be aligned correctly. | The scripting was causing an issue on the book details page. Adding the code to the bottom of the website {% block scripts %}\&lt;script src=&quot;{{ url\_for(&#39;static&#39;, filename=&#39;js/book\_detail\_script.js&#39;) }}&quot;\&gt;\&lt;/script\&gt;{% endblock %} fixed the structure of the website issue. |
| Image display issues | The image was a very small image and large description on the book details page. This is required to fit the webpage meaning a large image to accompany the text. | When selecting the book details page the image is very small. Its not suitable for the presentation nor is it suitable for anyone with any visual difficulty. | The div class in book details for the cover art was amended to large the information was supplied from materialize which has been mentioned in the acknowledgements for the information provided from their website. You can implement a size change by simple text included small medium large etc. This was amended to large and worked correctly. The code enabled large images on the webpage. |
| Search with generic words | When searching for books using and the website doesn&#39;t display any information. | On the home page search for a book using and, the, use. Generic words used every day that are very common. They have to be 3 characters anything less won&#39;t work. Anything more a book might appear depends on the letters. | The resolution for the search criteria is a safety measure I believe it could be fixed but if the database has thousands of books then it prevents having lots of books loading causing the web page issues. |

### Outstanding Defects

Safety measure to be implemented when deleting reviews as there is no warning asking are they sure on the system.
